# Squarathon

Welcome to **Squarathon**, a thrilling platformer game where agility and precision are your best friends. Developed in Python using the robust Pygame module, this game challenges you to navigate a cube through an ever-changing landscape of platforms. With a focus on simplicity and endless fun, Squarathon is perfect for quick play sessions aimed at beating your high score.

## Gameplay

Your cube moves automatically, gaining speed every 10 seconds, making each moment increasingly challenging. Your goal is to jump from platform to platform without falling off. The spacebar is your primary control — one tap to jump and double-tap for a double jump. As you progress, not only does the background dynamically change every 10 points, enhancing the visual experience, but the speed of your cube also increases, adding an extra layer of challenge to your high-score chase.
